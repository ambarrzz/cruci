- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of intellect and focus, drawing inspiration from the concentration required in software development.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), a desaturated version of the primary color, for a clean and non-distracting interface. This dark scheme supports prolonged focus.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700), analogous to indigo but contrasting enough, used for correct answer highlighting and the final key word reveal.
